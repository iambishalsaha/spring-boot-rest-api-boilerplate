# Spring Boot REST API Boilerplate

A boilerplate for Spring Boot with JWT authentication, email functionalities, and
much more.

## Overview
**Spring Boot REST API Boilerplate** is a Spring Boot boilerplate that
provides a solid foundation for building web applications with
JWT authentication, CORS filters, email functionalities, and more.
It comes with a set of features and configurations more fast as possible your development.
I will commit some improvements over time here and I will also
create a boilerplate in Kotlin as the next objective,
if possible send improvements to this project, I will insert crud abstraction here too and in Kotlin crud it will also
be something very similar to this.

## Features
- JWT authentication
- CORS filter configuration
- Token provider and JWT authentication filter

- Email functionalities (account creation, email verification, login, password reset, password forget)
- Example controller, service, repository, entity, and domain
- Exception handling
- Seeder for initial user creation with example permissions
- Lombok for simplified mapping and reduced boilerplate code
- Dockerfile for containerization
- Docker Compose for easy database setup
